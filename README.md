Exploring Machine Learning
Projects and notebooks following along using books such as:
Python Machine Learning (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka-ebook/dp/B00YSILNL0/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1503438067&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=python+machine+learning) and (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Science-Python-Machine-Learning/dp/1787280748/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503438466&sr=8-1&keywords=hands+on+data+science) along with tutorials from https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml

These projects aim to demonstrate and apply theoretical machine learning concepts, algoritms, workflows and data science practices beyond the introduction learnt from my Masters degree.
