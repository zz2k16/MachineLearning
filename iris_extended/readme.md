 Machine learning project submitted for a data science application test that required a simple solution to train and predict upon the famous Iris data set, as well as added functionality of predicting new unseen values
 
Using knowledge from my Masters and books such as Python Machine Learning (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka-ebook/dp/B00YSILNL0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1503437811&sr=8-2&keywords=python+machine+learning) I used best practices and methods to explore algorithms, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, data preprocessing and more.\
